# Inventory Manager

A project based off of the Udemy course [Build Real Software with Python, PyQt5 and QT Designer](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-pyqt5/). The project focuses on the creation of a mechanical fastener/parts inventory manager GUI that uses an SQLite3 database.

The course [Python GUI Programming Recipes using PyQt5](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-gui-programming-recipes-using-pyqt5/) was also used in support of this project.
